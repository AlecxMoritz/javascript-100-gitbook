# Strings

## Strings in JavaScript
We've already discussed numbers, so let's talk about another common data type in JavaScript, *strings*. The name might seem a bit strange, but thinking of strings as literal strings of alphanumeric characters might help. In JavaScript, a *string* is literally just a collection of text.

```let str = 'Hello World!'```

## Concatenation
*Concatenation* is the practice or joining strings and other values. Let's say we have two variables, one containing the string ```' apples'```, and another containing the numeric value of ```7```. If we wanted our console to print '7 apples', we'd have to *concatenate* them.

```console.log(7 + ' apples'); ```

Under the hood, JavaScript is doing something known as *type coercion* to turn the number ```7``` into a string for just long enough to print the line to the console. Going in depth into type coercion is out of the scope of out prework, but what's important to know is how we can get different types of values to print together with our strings.

## String Methods
JavaScript also has items called *string methods*. In class you will learn the difference between methods and functions and get to play around with them more. These special methods are able to make all of a string uppercase, or lowercase, or event split up the string into multiple strings. 

More detail about these methods are again out of scope, but moving forward they are something to be aware of. However, if you find you're wanting more of a challenge once your finished with your prework, string methods are something to take a good look at.

## Exercises
Try declaring a few string variables. Set their value's to any text you can think of. Your name, a pet's name, your best friend.

See if you can declare two strings, and concatenate them together. Try to get numbers to concatenate with your strings.

## Extra Challenge

Try to get your console to print. 'I had 7 apples, but I ate 3 of them'. Using four variables, two strings, two numbers, and concatenate them together.

Try declaring a variable for every part of your address(street, zip code, city, etc.), and try to get all of your address to print out with proper punctuation. 

Ex: 12175 Visionary Way, Fishers, IN 46038


## Additional Practice
For extra practice on string basics and concatenation, repeat the exercises again by hand. Annotate different parts of your writing.
