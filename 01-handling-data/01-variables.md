# Variables
* Introduce the idea of bindings or variables and why we use them
* Talk about naming variables, reserved words, and camel casing, and things not to do with variable names(best practices type stuff)
* Show examples and code dissections of declarations, initializations, and let const and var
* Emphasize using let when working with variables without getting into the idea of scope
* Practice creating variables, console.loging them, performing operations on them, and re-assigning variables
