# Booleans 

## Booleans in JavaScript
Booleans are a special kind of data type. They can only have one of two predefined values, ```true```, or ```false```. You can think of them as an on/off kind of thing, or an is/isn't. There isn't any gray area with booleans.

```let javaScriptIsAwesome = true;```

```let coffeeIsLame = false;```

## Exercises
Create some booleans for some of your favorite things. Make sure you're using both `true`, and `false` for values to gain exposure to both. 

## Additional Practice
For additional boolean practice, repeat the exercises by hand, and annotate different parts of your declarations and `console.log()`'s.
