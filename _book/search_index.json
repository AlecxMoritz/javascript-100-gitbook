programming. They allow us to hold onto and track values in our computers memory, and use them in different places in our applications and files.\nWhat Are Variables\nVariables, also sometimes called bindings, are a connection between a word, and a place in computer memory where data is stored. So a variable is not the actual data stored, nor is it the name we call it, but the connection between the two.\nUsing variables allows us to handle data in applications, and not loose track of data as soon as it is created. \nCreating Variables\nDeclaration\nWhen we declare a variable in JavaScript, we do so by using one of three keywords, let, var, and const followed by a name. We will primarily use let, but the reason behind this is beyond the scope of our prework.\nlet num;\nHere we are using let to declare a variable named num.\nAssignment\nIf you compare the example in Declaration with the example at the top of this page, you'll notice it's missing a part. We call that part assignment. It's where we assign the value, and store that value in memory.\nWhen we assign a variable a value, we use the assignment operator, which you may know as an equal sign. When we run our code, JavaScript will attempt to store anything on the right hand side as a value.\nlet num = 20;\nIn this example, we're declaring num, and we're also assigning it a value of 20, since 20 is on the right hand side of the assignment operator.\nNaming Variables\nCamel Casing\nIn programming different languages have different conventions. In JavaScript we use something called camel casing, which is where the first letter of the first word is undercased, but the first letter of every subsequent word is uppercased. So if we wanted to write Eleven Fifty Academy in camel casing, we would write elevenFiftyAcademy. Use camel casing for names of variables in JavaScript.\nReserved Words\nSome words in JavaScript as reserved, they could be keywords, classes, or methods. What exactly those are is out of scope for now, but it is important to know that not all words are valid names for variables.\nNumbers in Variable Names\nThere are a few things to be aware of with numbers in variable names. \nFirst, a variable cannot start with a numeric character. The following example will not work.\nlet 2nums = [ 1, 2 ];\nYou should also stay away from numeric characters in the variable's name.\nlet num1 = 2;\nlet numOne = 2;\nThe second line of this example is considered best practice.\nCode Dissection\n\nShow examples and code dissections of declarations, initializations, and let const and var\n\n[code image with dissection]\n[notes about dissection]\nCode Demo\n[video here]\nExercises\nPractice on your own by creating a few variables the have numeric values.\nThen try declaring a few variables, without assigning them values.\nUse console.log() to print the value of those variables to the console.\nAdditional Practice\nFor extra practice with variables, try the above exercises again. Then by hand. You can also write out the code by hand, and annotate the code with your own words.\n"},"01-handling-data/02-numbers-and-operators.html":{"url":"01-handling-data/02-numbers-and-operators.html","title":"Numbers and Operators","keywords":"","body":"Numbers and Operators\n\nIntroduce ‘numbers’ as a type in JS, basic binary operators, modulus, and short hand operators\nPractice console.loging various numbers with different operators being applied to them\n\n"},"01-handling-data/3-strings.html":{"url":"01-handling-data/3-strings.html","title":"Strings","keywords":"","body":"Strings\n\nIntroduce the idea of what a string is, why do we care\nShow code dissection of string variables and literals\nShow examples of concatenation\nExplain the existence of string methods and why they are useful\nCode demo of strings, using concatenation and methods\n\n"},"01-handling-data/04-booleans.html":{"url":"01-handling-data/04-booleans.html","title":"Booleans","keywords":"","body":"Booleans\n\nIntroduce what a boolean is and why do we care\nCode demo of basic boolean usages\n\n"},"02-control-flow/":{"url":"02-control-flow/","title":"Control Flow","keywords":"","body":"Control Flow\n[contents to be replaced]\nIf Statements\n\nStart with large section of notes about comparison operators, and equality operators\nExplain how an if statement isn’t exactly evaluating the statement inside the parentheses, but if the condition check is true of false\nExplain the basic idea of control flow and how we way want to do something only if the condition is ‘true’\nCode Demo of basic if statement usage\n\nIf/Else Statements\n\nExplain that using and else with an if gives us a ‘default option’\nShow a code dissection of a basic conditional using an if/else set up\nCode Demo of basic if/else usage\n\nElse If\n\nExplain that using else/if gives us more options to check for in our conditional blocks\nShow a code dissection of if, else, and else/if working together\nCode demo of basic else/if usage in conditional flow\n\nTernaries\n\nExplain that ternaries are essentially shorter hand conditionals\nCompare and contrast syntax between the two\nShort code demo on basic usage ternaries - explain that we will go more in depth in class\n\n"},"02-control-flow/01-if-statements.html":{"url":"02-control-flow/01-if-statements.html","title":"If Statements","keywords":"","body":"If Statements\n\nStart with large section of notes about comparison operators, and equality operators\nExplain how an if statement isn’t exactly evaluating the statement inside the parentheses, but if the condition check is true of false\nExplain the basic idea of control flow and how we way want to do something only if the condition is ‘true’\nCode Demo of basic if statement usage\n\n"},"02-control-flow/02-if-else-statements.html":{"url":"02-control-flow/02-if-else-statements.html","title":"If/Else Statements","keywords":"","body":"If/Else Statements\n\nExplain that using and else with an if gives us a ‘default option’\nShow a code dissection of a basic conditional using an if/else set up\nCode Demo of basic if/else usage\n\n"},"02-control-flow/03-else-if-statements.html":{"url":"02-control-flow/03-else-if-statements.html","title":"Else If Statements","keywords":"","body":"Else If\n\nExplain that using else/if gives us more options to check for in our conditional blocks\nShow a code dissection of if, else, and else/if working together\nCode demo of basic else/if usage in conditional flow\n\n"},"02-control-flow/04-ternaries.html":{"url":"02-control-flow/04-ternaries.html","title":"Ternaries","keywords":"","body":"Ternaries\n\nExplain that ternaries are essentially shorter hand conditionals\nCompare and contrast syntax between the two\nShort code demo on basic usage ternaries - explain that we will go more in depth in class\n\n"},"03-functions/":{"url":"03-functions/","title":"Functions","keywords":"","body":"Functions\n[contents to be replaced]\nModule Structure\n\nWhat are Functions and why do we care? \nHow to Create Functions - Declarations, Parameters and Multiple Arguments\nHow to Use Functions - Calling, Arguments\nHow to get Data Back - returns\nCode Demo\nAdditional Exercises\n\nContents\n\nExplain the idea of functions, and why we care\nShow code dissections of declarations, calls, parameters, and arguments, then multiple arguments and returns\nCode demo with basic function usage.
