* Start with large section of notes about comparison operators, and equality operators
* Explain how an if statement isn’t exactly evaluating the statement inside the parentheses, but if the condition check is true of false
* Explain the basic idea of control flow and how we way want to do something only if the condition is ‘true’
* Code Demo of basic if statement usage


## If/Else Statements
* Explain that using and else with an if gives us a ‘default option’
* Show a code dissection of a basic conditional using an if/else set up
* Code Demo of basic if/else usage


## Else If
* Explain that using else/if gives us more options to check for in our conditional blocks
* Show a code dissection of if, else, and else/if working together
* Code demo of basic else/if usage in conditional flow


## Ternaries
* Explain that ternaries are essentially shorter hand conditionals
* Compare and contrast syntax between the two
* Short code demo on basic usage ternaries - explain that we will go more in depth in class
