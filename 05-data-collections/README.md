## Objects

* Explain the ideas of properties, and methods, and how to use dot notation
* Explain the difference between a function and a method
* Code demo of basic object creation and usage, using dot notation to access different properties, and play around with a few object methods
* Code demo will touch on what happens if you try to access a property that doesnâ€™t exist -- perhaps include a link to something talking about undefined in the 'extra practice/reading' section

* Explain the ideas of arrays as numerically index data collections
* Show code dissections to talk about the array indexing and square bracket notation
* Code demo of basic array usage and a few array methods
